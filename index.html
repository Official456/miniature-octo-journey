          <h3>Investment Apps</h3>
          <p>
            Investment apps allow you to invest in stocks,cryptocurrencies, and
            other assets directly from your smartphone. This key is to choose
            reputabe apps with low fees and a user-friendly interface. In my
            case, i will recommend to trade your all your assets with Binance.
            <br />
            Binance is one of the world's largest and most popular
            cryptocurrency exchanges. It was founded in 2017 by Changpeng Zhao
            (also known as CZ) and has quickly grown to become a dominant player
            in the cryptocurrency market.

          <h3>Survey Apps</h3>
          <p>
            Survey apps pay you for completing surveys and providing feedback.
            You can sign up for multiple apps to maximize your earnings. Always
            look for apps that offer a good return for your time. Popular survey
            apps as of my last update included SurveyMonkey, Google Forms,
            Typeform, Qualtrics, and SurveyGizmo, but there are many other
            options available. Register for an account to start earning
            passively.
